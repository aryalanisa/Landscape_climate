**Maximum LST**
This script uses Google Earth Engine to compute the maximum daytime land surface temperature (LST) in Celsius from MODIS data (`MOD11A1`) for a region of interest (ROI) between your time of interest (e.g. April 2023-October 2023).

**Landscapemetrics** 
This script uses R to compute different landscapemetrics using land cover map of certain region and shows how the metrics were calculated by adding grids over region. This code also contains how topographical data were incorporated for grid cells to create datasets. 

**XGBoost regression**
This script uses R for regression analysis using XGBoost model. LST is the target variable and all other features are predicting variables. 

**SHAP analysis**
This script uses python for SHAP analysis using Tree.explainer.
