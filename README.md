**Maximum LST**
This script uses Google Earth Engine to compute the maximum daytime land surface temperature (LST) in Celsius from MODIS data (`MOD11A1`) for a region of interest (ROI) between your time of interest (e.g. April 2023-October 2023).
#key steps
- Filter MODIS images by date and region
- Convert LST from Kelvin to Celsius
- Compute pixel-wise maximum
- Clip to ROI

#Output
A single image of maximum LST per pixel in Â°C

**Landscapemetrics** 
This script uses R to compute different landscapemetrics using land cover map of certain region and shows how the metrics were calculated by adding grids over region. This code also contains how topographical data were incorporated for grid cells to create datasets.
